            India is home to one third of the blind people in the world. Yet, the conventional Braille system favours only the english
            speaking population. Over two thirds of the indian population resides in rural areas. India being a developing country, the
            literacy rate and access to technology is extremely disproportionate. This difference is especially stark when it comes to the
            rural population where the use english is limited.
